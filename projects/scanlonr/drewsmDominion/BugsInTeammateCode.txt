Dominion-001: Bug in implementation of Adventurer card.

Details:

    Type: Bug
    Priority: Major
    Affected Version: drewsm-assignment-4 branch
    Components: Card Implementation
    Labels: None
    Status: Open
    Resolution: Unresolved
    Fixed Version: None

Description:

    The implementation of the Adventurer card does not correctly add drawn
    cards which are not treasure cards to the player's discard pile. This bug
    was uncovered during unit testing of the Adventurer implementation.

    Minimal/Real Word Example:

        gameState 'G' initialized and containing the following values.
        numPlayers: 2
    	whoseTurn: 0
    	handCount: 5
    		hand[0]: 4
    		hand[1]: 4
    		hand[2]: 4
    		hand[3]: 4
    		hand[4]: 7
    	deckCount: 4
    		deck[0]: 6
    		deck[1]: 5
    		deck[2]: 4
    		deck[3]: 13
    	discardCount: 0

        adventurerEffect(&G, G->whoseTurn);

        After this call, the Smithy card '13' will not be correctly added to
        the players discard pile.

Dominion-002: Bug in implementation of Steward card.

Details:

    Type: Bug
    Priority: Major
    Affected Version: drewsm-assignment-4 branch
    Components: Card Implementation
    Labels: None
    Status: Open
    Resolution: Unresolved
    Fixed Versions: None

Description:

    The implementation of the Steward card fails to remove the currently played
    card from the player's hand. A correct implementation should move the
    currently played card into the player's played card pile. This bug was
    revealed during random testing of the Steward implementation. This bug shows
    up regardless of the value of the player's 'choice1'.

    Minimal/Real Word Example:

    gameState 'G' initialized and containing the following values.
    numPlayers:      2
    whoseTurn:       0
    phase:           0
    numActions:      1
    coins:           23
    numBuys:         1
    handCount:       431
    deckCount:       37
    discardCount:    100
    playedCardCount: 0
    choice1 = 0 or 3
    stewardEffect(choice1, 0, 0, &G, 0, G->whoseTurn);

    gameState 'G' initialized and containing the following values.
    numPlayers:      2
    whoseTurn:       0
    phase:           0
    numActions:      1
    coins:           41
    numBuys:         1
    handCount:       96
    deckCount:       303
    discardCount:    472
    playedCardCount: 0
    choice1 = 2
    stewardEffect(choice1, 0, 0, &G, 0, G->whoseTurn);

    gameState 'G' initialized and containing the following values.
    numPlayers:      2
    whoseTurn:       0
    phase:           0
    numActions:      1
    coins:           3
    numBuys:         1
    handCount:       85
    deckCount:       412
    discardCount:    269
    playedCardCount: 0
    choice1 = 1;
    stewardEffect(choice1, 0, 0, &G, 0, G->whoseTurn);

    Note that this bug is always revealed during random testing, when the
    gameState is created with random combinations of card within the
    various 'piles'. Therefore, it is unlikely that the specific combination
    of cards within any of the piles affects the production of this bug. For
    this reason, and the sake of brevity, the specific order of cards
    for the gameStates which revealed this bug are omitted above.
